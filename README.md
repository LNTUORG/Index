**DO  NOT MAKE CHANGE IN MASTER BRANCH !!!**

**For import thing I always repeat three times.**

If you want to make changes, you are supposed to create a new branch named such as `new/yourOrgName`, about this, you'd better obay the follow rules, in order to make less something terrible. The rule is:

* if you add new organization's introduce, you can create a branch named `new/yourOrgName`.
* if you want to edit something, you can create a branch named `edit/yourOrgName`.

Then you can edit it freely in your branch, after editing, you can make a pull-request to develop or master branch. We will merge it after review.
