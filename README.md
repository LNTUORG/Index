### Domain ownership

The domain `lntu.org` is our root domain, if you are an in-school organization, you can contact us for an unique second-class domain for free.

For example, the education admin system app is a project for LNTU, we use the name `online.lntu.org` for this project's website, what's more, `online.lntu.org` is just a show website, we use `api.online.lntu.org` for C/S communication, we use `open.online.lntu.org` for develop document. you can use it for anyway but do not break the law.

#### How to own the domain

You can see the document [here](wiki/DomainDNS.md)

### Vhost

vhost is virtual host, now it just support php, you can use static html page or WordPress based on php.

### Database

If you use static html page, you can ignore this.

If you use some CMS like Wordpress, when you install, it will ask you input database name & account & password.

### ORG-Mail

If you don't want your private email for business use, you can ask me for an organization email like `yourname@lntu.org`, in fact you can apply for any prefix if nothing changes -- **DO NOT BREAK THE LAW**, and you are free.

## Push introduce to the below list

First, when you contact us, we will invite you to this project, then you are a member of this project.

You have authority to change anything.

**BUT**

**DO NOT MAKE CHANGE IN MASTER BRANCH !!!**

**DO NOT MAKE CHANGE IN MASTER BRANCH !!!**

**DO NOT MAKE CHANGE IN MASTER BRANCH !!!**

**For important thing I always repeat three times.**

If you want to make changes, you are supposed to create a new branch named such as `new/yourOrgName`, about this, you'd better obay the follow rules, in order to make less something terrible. The rule is:

* if you add new organization's introduce, you can create a branch named `new/yourOrgName`.
* if you want to edit something, you can create a branch named `edit/yourOrgName`.

Then you can edit it freely in your branch, after editing, you can make a pull-request to develop or master branch. We will merge it after review.

Of course, if you think you have enough ability to deal with git, you can be an exception. We make rules just for fresher.
