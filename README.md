## Before text

I found this community last term at Apr 18 2015, at first, I was eager to make it strong, if you want to get the detail, here is the [post](https://pupboss.com/a-lntu-platform/) I wrote last term.

Actually, my thought was great, but my move was wrong, completely wrong.

A huge number of people is not necessary  to a healthy group, China has never lacked people, so what. We need genius, at least he isn't a person that is called to '伸手党' in Chinese.

Inspired by B3LOG -- An open source community, I'm going to restart this project now.

From now on, only Hackers and Painters were welcomed to join us, but why? I will explain it below.

## Welcome

Welcome to Liaoning Technical University Organization. 

This is a platform for outstanding student in Liaoning Technical University that only programmers and designers are needed.

The world consists of two parts, one is creating, and another is destroying. Our job is creating so we only need someone to create and someone to make it better to use.

## Rules

- Do not talk about any channel to get any illegal copy software movies and music
- Speak foreign languages as much as possible
- Do not reprint any web pages but share a link
- Make your content helpful, do not post your content like '顶', '路过', '前排', '66666' and ect
- You can't delete your posts, so think again before publishing
- Do not infringe any intellectual property right of another or the privacy or publicity rights of another
- Do not libelous, defamatory, abusive, threatening, harassing, hateful, offensive or otherwise violates any law or right of any third party
- This is a free community, and you are not controlled by chinese laws. **JUST FOLLOW YOUR BASE LINE**

## Our wishes

Traditionally, the mode of a Chinese community is a big boss and a lot of silly B users. The boss just like a god, nothing is impossible, was responsible for other users everything, and be satisfied by the praise from those guys.

Here, the wall was born, you can see the words like 'Annex replies visible' 'This topic is not open to your user group' anywhere. Once a forum got a boss, the forum wins.

We're going to breake this gold rule.

If you are neither a creator nor a designer, please press Ctrl+F4 or Command+Q, this community may not suitable for you.

Let's make ourself better by chatting with excellent people.
